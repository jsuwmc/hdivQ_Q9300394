/**
 * Globally unique identifier generator.
 * <p>
 * In the multitude of java GUID generators, I found none that guaranteed randomness. GUIDs are guaranteed to be globally unique by using
 * ethernet MACs, IP addresses, time elements, and sequential numbers. GUIDs are not expected to be random and most often are easy/possible
 * to guess given a sample from a given generator. SQL Server, for example generates GUID that are unique but sequencial within a given
 * instance.
 * <p>
 * GUIDs can be used as security devices to hide things such as files within a filesystem where listings are unavailable (e.g. files that
 * are served up from a Web server with indexing turned off). This may be desireable in cases where standard authentication is not
 * appropriate. In this scenario, the RandomGuids are used as directories. Another example is the use of GUIDs for primary keys in a
 * database where you want to ensure that the keys are secret. Random GUIDs can then be used in a URL to prevent hackers (or users) from
 * accessing records by guessing or simply by incrementing sequential numbers.
 * <p>
 * There are many other possiblities of using GUIDs in the realm of security and encryption where the element of randomness is important.
 * This class was written for these purposes but can also be used as a general purpose GUID generator as well.
 * <p>
 * RandomGuid generates truly random GUIDs by using the system's IP address (name/IP), system time in milliseconds (as an integer), and a
 * very large random number joined together in a single String that is passed through an MD5 hash. The IP address and system time make the
 * MD5 seed globally unique and the random number guarantees that the generated GUIDs will have no discernable pattern and cannot be guessed
 * given any number of previously generated GUIDs. It is generally not possible to access the seed information (IP, time, random number)
 * from the resulting GUIDs as the MD5 hash algorithm provides one way encryption.
 * <p>
 * <b>Security of RandomGuid</b>: RandomGuid can be called one of two ways -- with the basic java Random number generator or a
 * cryptographically strong random generator (SecureRandom). The choice is offered because the secure random generator takes about 3.5 times
 * longer to generate its random numbers and this performance hit may not be worth the added security especially considering the basic
 * generator is seeded with a cryptographically strong random seed.
 * <p>
 * Seeding the basic generator in this way effectively decouples the random numbers from the time component making it virtually impossible
 * to predict the random number component even if one had absolute knowledge of the System time. Thanks to Ashutosh Narhari for the
 * suggestion of using the static method to prime the basic random generator.
 * <p>
 * Using the secure random option, this class complies with the statistical random number generator tests specified in FIPS 140-2, Security
 * Requirements for Cryptographic Modules, secition 4.9.1.
 * <p>
 * I converted all the pieces of the seed to a String before handing it over to the MD5 hash so that you could print it out to make sure it
 * contains the data you expect to see and to give a nice warm fuzzy. If you need better performance, you may want to stick to byte[]
 * arrays.
 * <p>
 * I believe that it is important that the algorithm for generating random GUIDs be open for inspection and modification. This class is free
 * for all uses.
